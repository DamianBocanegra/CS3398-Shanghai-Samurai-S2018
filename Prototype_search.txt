#Search function
#Find algorithm and then print contents of a file with information on algorithm
#Will take search term (string) input in from search field, and a database of algorithm objects 
#Will be imporved over development cycle, this is the bare bones of it.
#Algorithms will be objects 

Algorithm object
Attributes:
String name
String txt_filename
int viewed #used to find popularity of this algorithm, will be implemented later.


#The string input will be compared to the algorithm object attribute name and see if the input string is a substring
#It will be added to a list of search results
#After all results are found the list of search results will be presented to the user.
#The user will select the the algorithm they wish to see
#The Algorithm objects attribute txt_filename will then be used to get the information on the algorithm stored in a file.
